  'I am a 25 year old Frontend Developer, based in BÃ¦rum, Norway. I recently graduated from Noroff and landed a job as a Frontend Developer at Hurtigruten Group.',
  "I chose Frontend Development as I have a great passion for structure and creativity, and I've found a way to implement both these passions of mine into the work. I burn for userfriendly design and writing clean code. I truly enjoy writing code and find myself doing extra courses and coming up with new projects on my spare time.",
  "On my spare time I like to workout in the gym and taking hikes in the mountains. Otherwise, I'm a cheerful girl who enjoys spreading the joy of life all around. To me happiness is everything, and this line of work truly makes me happy!",
