        <p className="paragraph">
          I am a {currentAge} year old Frontend Developer based in Oslo, Norway.
          I studied Frontend Development at Noroff and graduated at the top of
          my class the summer of 2021.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          I chose Frontend Development as I have a great passion for structure
          and creativity, and I've found a way to implement both these passions
          of mine into the work. I burn for userfriendly design and writing
          clean code. I truly enjoy writing code and find myself doing extra
          courses and coming up with new projects on my spare time.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Otherwise, I'm a cheerful girl who enjoys spreading the joy of life
          all around. To me happiness is everything, and this line of work truly
          makes me happy!
